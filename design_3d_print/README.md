# 3D-printed Parts

All `.stl` files for 3D-printed parts have been uploaded to Thingiverse.
[Download files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3194140/files)

There are three different ways you can get these parts printed:

1. If you own or have access to a 3D-printer, you can download the `.stl` files, import them to a slicer (Cura is recommended) and print them yourself. 
NOTE: In the slicer, you will need to [orient the parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqRbSkX5IJk) for optimal printing.

2. If you do *not* own or have access to a 3D-printer, you can search for a third-party printing service like Shapeways to have them print and deliver these parts for you.

3. (COMING SOON) You can order a kit through a recommended distributor.
